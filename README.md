# JSLocalStorage
Implementation of JS Local Storage and Timing Challenge Posted On GADS2020 Slack Workspace

This challenge is my own implementation of the challenge. It is an effort to boost my JS Knowledge which will help in my next Live Project.

Do you care so much? Then check out the **[old_script.js](https://github.com/Festusali/JSLocalStorage/blob/master/js/old_script.js/ "Old Implementation of script.js")** file and see what I did initially before refactoring the code.

Feel free to use the code and contribute improvements. The license file guides if need be.

Here is the **[Code Repo](https://github.com/Festusali/JsLocalStorage.git "JavaScript Time Show and Local Storage Challenge Repo")**. You can check the **[Demo Live Site](https://jslocalstorage.netlify.app/ "JavaScript Time Show Challenge")**.

If you would like to take a look at the Former Challenge, checkout the repo **[JS Time Challenge](https://github.com/Festusali/JsTimeChallenge.git/ "Initial JavaScript Timing Challenge")** or the **[Live Demo](https://jstiming.netlify.app/ "Initial JavaScript Timing Challenge Demo Site")**
